[The old version of this website](https://kepmon.github.io/Caloric_calculator/) was created to practice some JS during my learning process.

**UPDATE**  
Currently, the project is being refactored to assure better standards of code quality, maintability, and accessibility. The rest of this README will be updated at the end of the refactoring process.  
*End of update*

However, I found this kind of website actually needed since most websites I saw on calculating caloric intake usually lack some important questions, such as:
* body fat percentage - this information is important for the calculator's accuracy, particularly for people with low body fat percentage. Even so, most such websites won't ask you about your body fat percentage, probably because most people aren't aware of this value and/or it's hard to evaluate this number, in the first place. That's why I decided to provide some photos, covering wide range of body fat percentages, for both men and women.

* daily caloric exhaust - many people nowadays use certain apps that track their caloric exhaust. Since those apps usually ask the user to input their weight, the accuracy of the calories burnt throughout the day is fairly good. And, as for calculating caloring intake, this kind of information is much more reliable than estimating the level of activity. Nevertheless, for those who don't know their daily caloric exhaust, I provided a detailed description on the kind of activities that should be assigned to each level of activity.

Therefore, I though I could address some issue concurrently with learning.
